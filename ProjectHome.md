The System Status Dashboard (SSD) is a status dashboard designed to provide an easy to understand view into an organization's infrastructure health status.  SSD is modeled after status dashboard services like Google's App Status and Amazon's Service Health Dashboard and displays a matrix of services, dates and their corresponding status in an easy to read calendar view.  Services can be web sites, APIs, internal IT systems, or anything else about which your users or customers require timely status information.  SSD allows system administrators to easily create and track incidents or schedule system maintenance and provides an excellent historical reference for SLA performance calculations.

SSD is written in Python, utilizing the Django web framework and is very easy to install and configure on most platforms.
